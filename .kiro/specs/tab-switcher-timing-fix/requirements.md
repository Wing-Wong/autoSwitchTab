# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the timing issue in the browser extension where tab switching fails to work when the stay time is set to longer intervals (50+ seconds or 120+ seconds). The extension currently works fine with shorter intervals (30 seconds or less) but fails with longer durations due to service worker lifecycle limitations and improper timing mechanism implementation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to set tab switching intervals longer than 60 seconds, so that I can have more flexible control over tab switching timing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user sets a stay time greater than 60 seconds THEN the system SHALL accept and store the value without validation errors
2. WHEN the user sets a stay time up to 300 seconds (5 minutes) THEN the system SHALL support this maximum limit
3. IF the user enters a value outside the valid range THEN the system SHALL display appropriate validation messages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the tab switching to work reliably with long intervals, so that the extension functions consistently regardless of the timing setting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the stay time is set to 50 seconds or more THEN the system SHALL continue switching tabs at the specified intervals
2. WHEN the service worker is inactive for extended periods THEN the system SHALL automatically reactivate and resume tab switching
3. WHEN the browser has been idle for long periods THEN the system SHALL maintain the tab switching schedule without interruption
4. IF the service worker is terminated by the browser THEN the system SHALL restore the tab switching state upon reactivation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the extension to use browser-native timing mechanisms, so that it works reliably with the browser's lifecycle management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up timing intervals THEN the system SHALL use Chrome Alarms API instead of setTimeout for intervals longer than 30 seconds
2. WHEN the alarm triggers THEN the system SHALL execute the tab switching logic and schedule the next alarm
3. IF an alarm fails to trigger THEN the system SHALL have fallback mechanisms to detect and recover from missed intervals
4. WHEN the extension is disabled and re-enabled THEN the system SHALL properly restore alarm schedules

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback about the extension's status, so that I can understand whether it's working correctly with long intervals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension is running with long intervals THEN the system SHALL provide status indicators showing the next switch time
2. WHEN there are timing issues THEN the system SHALL log appropriate error messages for debugging
3. IF the service worker restarts THEN the system SHALL log the restoration of tab switching functionality
4. WHEN the user opens the options page THEN the system SHALL display the current operational status
